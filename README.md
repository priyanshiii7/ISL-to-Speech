# ISL-to-Speech
A ML project that detect and converts real time Indian Sign Language to Speech.

ISL to Speech - is a real-time sign language interpretation system that captures hand gestures via webcam and translates them into spoken words using a combination of MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Python. Designed to support two-hand signs, it helps bridge communication between the hearing and speech-impaired and the general public.

The project uses hand landmark detection and geometric feature extraction, mapped to predefined sign gestures. Though primarily rule-based, it follows a supervised learning structure and can be extended with a trained ML model or CNN for more dynamic classification.
